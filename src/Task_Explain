_2_Warm_up_challenges
1. List with values -> how many pairs of socks can be made from the values in this sheet List.
2. String charAt -> a tourist walks up and down at sea level, which we consider to be 1
3. Jumping On The Cloud -> Iterate list, with value 0 and 1, and if we have 1 we miss them and
   continues to iterate.
4. Repeat String 'a' -> how many times is repeat char 'a', after we do it new String.

_3_Arrays
1. 6x6 Array -> find maxSum in every hourglass. List<List<Integer>>
2. Rotate ArrayList, how many times you are give by user
3. New year chaos
4. Minimum swap in array

_4_Dictionaries And Hashmaps
1. HashTablesRansomNote -> Two list compare words.
2. TwoStrings -> determine if they share a common substring.
3. SherlockAndAnagrams -> The number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.
4. CountTriplets -> common ratio "r" and i < j < k.
5. FrequencyQueries

_5_Sorting
1. BubbleSort ->  Bubble sort with List
2. MarkAndToys -> _5_Sorting and iterate the list
3. Comparator -> compare two object

_6_String Manipulation
1. Anagram - how many delete on two words to have a anagram
2. AlternatingCharacters -> find how many delete character does not have matching adjacent characters.
3. AlternatingCharactersAdvance -> print the String with does not have matching adjacent characters.
4. SpecialStringAgain -> the same character
5. CommonChild -> Longest Common Subsequence

_7_GreedyAlgorithms
1. minimumAbsoluteDifference - in array
2. LuckBalance
